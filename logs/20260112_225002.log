2026-01-12 22:58:34 - Recommendation_agents.recommendation - INFO -    Recommendation: Based on the applicant's data, I recommend "Financial Support" - Direct monetary aid for immediate needs. The applicant has a monthly income of AED 4500, which is less than AED 10000, indicating financial strain. Additionally, they have no dependents, and their total savings are AED 39267, leaving little to no cushion for emergency funds.

I chose this recommendation because the applicant's limited financial resources (less than AED 10000/month) suggest a need for direct monetary aid to alleviate immediate expenses, such as rent/mortgage, food, and utility bills.
