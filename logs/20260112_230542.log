2026-01-12 23:07:10 - Recommendation_agents.recommendation - INFO -    Recommendation: Based on the provided data, I recommend "Financial Support" - Direct monetary aid for immediate needs. 

The applicant's medical severity score is 0, indicating they are generally fit and have no disabilities. They also have a relatively stable income of AED 16000 per month, with total savings of AED 18818. Additionally, the property value is zero, suggesting that the applicant may not be able to afford housing costs directly.

This recommendation is driven by the fact that the applicant has no medical severity greater than 3 (0 in this case), and they have a stable employment situation with 10 years of experience. They also do not have any dependents who are less than or equal to 3, which would impact their ability to receive financial support through family assistance programs.
