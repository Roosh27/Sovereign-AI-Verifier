However, considering her specific data points, such as her monthly income of 4000 AED and total savings of 16,698 AED, it's clear that she is financially stable and capable of supporting herself, which contradicts the SOFT DECLINE criteria.

2026-01-12 19:46:33 - agents.decision - INFO -    Reason: For Cindy Martinez, a Social Support Decision is made through a SOFT DECLINE process. This decision typically considers factors such as her financial situation, employment status, and health, but in this case, we can see that she has met the basic requirements for social support eligibility. We acknowledge her financial struggles with monthly income of 4000 AED, which may be challenging to cover expenses, and note that her dependents are fully covered by her income, suggesting a complex family situation.
