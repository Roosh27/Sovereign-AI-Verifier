2026-01-12 20:56:24 - agents.decision - INFO -    Reason: Dear Jeffrey,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for our social support services. We appreciate your interest in our program and wish you all the best in addressing your current challenges.

After careful review of your application, we regret to inform you that we cannot approve your request at this time due to your employment status as an employed individual with a total savings of AED 39,267 and a monthly income of AED 4,500. While these financial resources are suitable for your needs, they do not indicate the same level of financial capacity that our program aims to support.

We want to emphasize that we take into account your employment status as a strength in this decision, suggesting that you have the means to meet your current expenses without assistance. However, we also recognize that your employment income should be sufficient to cover any unforeseen expenses or shortfalls.

Given that your dependents' needs are currently not expected to exceed our program's capacity, we do not see any medical condition requiring support at this time. Nevertheless, please note that we will continue to monitor your situation and may reevaluate your eligibility if circumstances change.

We encourage you to review the terms of our social support services and reach out to us whenever your financial stability or employment status warrants a reconsideration. Our goal is to ensure that all individuals have access to necessary resources to lead fulfilling lives, regardless of their current circumstances.
